## 🚀 About

This project was created with the assistance of AI, specifically Claude 3.5 Sonnet, to showcase the potential of AI in software development. It's a Next.js application that serves as a comprehensive toolkit for developers, featuring a collection of useful tools and resources. The development process was further enhanced using Cursor Composer as the AI-powered code editor, demonstrating the synergy between AI assistants and intelligent development environments.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

This Developer's Toolkit is a Next.js application built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. It demonstrates modern web development practices, including:

- ✅ Next.js App Router for efficient routing and server-side rendering
- ✅ TypeScript for type-safe code
- ✅ Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first styling
- ✅ shadcn/ui for pre-built, customizable UI components
- ✅ Server Components for improved performance
- ✅ API routes using Next.js Route Handlers

The project aims to inspire developers by showcasing how AI can assist in creating well-structured, efficient, and feature-rich applications.
