Include icons representing security, encryption, and data integrity. The background should be tech-inspired, with subtle circuit patterns or binary code elements. Use a color scheme that conveys trust and security, such as blues and greens, and ensure the overall design looks intuitive and user-friendly."

## üìä Base64 Encoder/Decoder Tool

"Create a sleek and modern illustration of a Base64 encoder/decoder tool interface. The design should feature an input area for raw data (text or files) and an output area displaying the encoded Base64 string. Include buttons for encoding and decoding, along with icons representing data transformation and digital encoding. The background should be tech-oriented, with abstract shapes or patterns that suggest data flow. Use a color palette that conveys innovation and clarity, with contrasting colors to highlight different sections of the interface. Ensure the overall layout is clean and user-friendly."

## üåê HTTP Status Code Reference Tool

"Create a modern JPG illustration of an HTTP status code reference tool interface. The design should display a list of common HTTP status codes (like 200, 404, 500) alongside their descriptions and categories (e.g., success, client error, server error). Include a search bar for easy navigation and icons representing web communication, like a globe or network symbols. The background should be clean and tech-inspired, using a color scheme that conveys clarity and professionalism, such as blues and grays. Ensure the layout is organized and user-friendly, making it easy for developers to reference information quickly."

## üîç IP Address Lookup Tool

"Create a modern JPG illustration of an IP address lookup tool interface. The design should feature an input field where users can enter an IP address, with a display area showing the results, including geographic location, ISP, and other relevant information. Include icons representing networking, such as a globe, magnifying glass, or location pin. The background should be tech-oriented, with subtle patterns that suggest connectivity. Use a color palette that conveys reliability and clarity, such as greens and blues. Ensure the layout is clean, intuitive, and user-friendly for both casual users and tech professionals."

## üìù JSON Formatter Tool

"Create a modern JPG illustration of a JSON formatter tool interface. The design should showcase an input area for raw JSON data and a formatted output area that displays the structured JSON in a clear, readable format. Include buttons for formatting and validating the JSON, as well as icons representing data structure, such as brackets or trees. The background should be clean and tech-inspired, with subtle coding elements or patterns. Use a color palette that conveys clarity and functionality, such as blues and whites. Ensure the layout is organized and user-friendly, making it easy for developers to format and validate JSON data quickly."

## ‚è∞ Timestamp Converter Tool

"Create a modern JPG illustration of a timestamp converter tool interface. The design should feature input fields for entering timestamps in various formats (like Unix, ISO 8601) and an output area displaying the converted date and time. Include buttons for converting and resetting, along with icons representing time, such as clocks or calendars. The background should be clean and tech-inspired, using subtle patterns that suggest timekeeping. Use a color palette that conveys clarity and precision, such as blues and grays. Ensure the layout is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for users to convert timestamps effortlessly."

## üî¨ RegExp Tester Tool

"Create a modern JPG illustration of a regex tester tool interface. The design should feature an input area for users to enter their regular expressions and a separate input field for test strings. Include a results section that displays matches, errors, or explanations of the regex. Add buttons for testing, clearing the inputs, and examples, along with icons representing patterns, such as a magnifying glass or code brackets. The background should be clean and tech-inspired, using subtle coding elements. Use a color palette that conveys clarity and functionality, such as greens and blues. Ensure the layout is organized and user-friendly, making it easy for developers to test and refine their regular expressions."
